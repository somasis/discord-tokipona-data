A work-in-progress translation of Discord into Toki Pona.

The original strings are currently gathered from strings present in Discord-Dataminingâ€™s
{url-datamining}[current.js]. The strings used in this translation in `mama_pi_ante_toki.json`.
The strings in `mama_pi_ante_toki.json` should be consistent in meaning with the ones in this
translation; they will only be updated only when the translations are updated to match them.

== Usage

This data is to be used by other plugins which provide the actual code for injecting the
translated strings into Discord's code.

.Plugins which use this translation
* {url-discord-tokipona}[discord-tokipona]: A plugin for Replugged.

== Dialect and Phrasing Choices

* Mentions are "toki wile".
  Messages of desire, or desirious messages, because ultimately a mention is a message sent for
  want of the person who is being mentioned.
* Notifications are "kama toki".
  They are things that bring about knowledge of message-arrivals to you.
* Number representation.
  This translation uses words for numbers 0 through 2, and any larger simply displaying
  numeric amounts.
    ** Time representation is a different story.
       As of now, to keep the specific times and avoid obscuring information the client is giving
       to the user, for seconds, minutes, and hours, tenpo ilo lili, tenpo ilo, and tenpo ilo suli
       are used.
       This way is works well enough without requiring people to learn a different time system,
       or being unclear.
* Non-pu words are kept as minimal as possible, for dialectical neutrality, as jan Sonja's dialect
  as shown in _pu_ is essentially the lowest common denominator for speaking.
    ** This is in part from me not wanting to do this only for the _ma pona pi toki pona_ Discord.
       This plugin is for all people, be they in _ma pona_ or not.
       A _pu_ dialect ensures that it does not get biased one way or the other.
       _nimi ku suli_ are not used as well, as _ku_ was based entirely off of _ma pona pi toki pona_
       surveying, thus it seems better to avoid it as since most of the words aren't crucial anyway.
    ** "linja" is used for referring to connections and URLs, as its most common alternate meanings
       are lines and connections.
    ** I cannot make the same guarantee for the grammar choices; I studied for a while before
       getting my hands on _lipu pu_, so I am probably not staying entirely true to its grammar
       and preverbs.
       If you have any patches to send in for making the dialect more pu-like (without making things
       less clear, or long-winded), I welcome them.

== Things left untranslated

* Emojis.
  I'm not sure how this would be changed but I don't really think it's worth the effort to try and
  translate _every single emoji name and shortcode_ into Toki Pona right now.
  That is a different project.
* Names of connections. (ex. Battle.net, Facebook, GitHub)
  Usually, these names can't be changed by official translations even, likely for trademark reasons.
  Most occurences are not in the original English strings.

== Known issues

It would be nice to move the contributing process to something like https://crowdin.com/[Crowdin],
https://weblate.org[Weblate] (used by Replugged and others, notably), or something like it.
This would greatly reduce the barrier to entry for contributions from other users.
